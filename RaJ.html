  <b>ACT 1</b>
  <p><b>Prologue</b>
  <p>Two households,both alike in dignity</p>
  <p>In fair Verona,where we lay our scence.</p>
  <p>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny.
  <p>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
  <p>From forth the fatal Ioins of thease two foes.</p>
  <p>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life.
    <p>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</p>
  Do with their death bury their parents strife.
  <p>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd  love,</p>
  <p>And the continuance of their parents rage,</p>
  <p>Which,but their children's end ,nought could remove,</p>
 <p>Is now the two hour's traffic of our stage.
 <p>The which if you with patient ears attend
  <p>What here shall miss,our toil shall strive to mend</p>
  <b>SCENE I.Verona.A public place.</b>
  <p>Enter Samson and Grerory,of the house of Copulet armed with swards and buckers.
 <p><b>SAMPSON<b></p>
 <p>Gregory,o'my word we'll not carry coals.</p>
 <p> GREGORY</p>
   <p>No,for then we should be colliers.
